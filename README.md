Analysis of 2016 USA presidential elections

The 2016 US presidential election held on November 8th was the 58th American presidential election.

The 2016 election marked the first time in American presidential history that a candidate was elected without any prior experience in public service, and the first time a woman was nominated by a major party.

The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democrat ticket of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine.

Donald Trump obtained the required majority to become President-elect of the United States, winning 30 states with 306 electors out of 538. His victory had been considered unlikely by most media forecasts.

President Barack Obama served office for 2 terms (2008-2012 and 2012-2016)

Having set enough base for the Democratic Party Candidate â€“ Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton relied on electoral votes in states that have been longtime democratic strongholds.

However in a turn of events the Democrats lost 3 major states PA, MI and WI.
